My Algorithm to solve test D
âš  SPOILER ALERT

Got max-47 books on D. It was quite tough. 
Solution is this
ðŸ”˜ first of all add all libs

âžŠ Remove some libs - first those removing which doesn't remove any books, then those that are only required for one book
âž‹ Put libs that can yield +books back on, prioritizing those libs that add most books.
** I do removal in a wise greedy way with heuristic that prioritizes removal of libs that will disable least number of other libs from being removed.
** Some randomization is also added to greediness.

I repeat that for many many iterations and slowly the worst libs sort of fall off while the best ones crystallize by becoming too key to be peeled off. They are key to more books than those which we peel off.
So for me the amount of libs that provide any books went down from >15500 to 15047.
Then I just peel off the libs that provide me with only a single unique book and put them at the end of the output sequence, while the rest is put at the beginning.
